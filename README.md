# reinforcement

Folders:

* prove: contains trails with State and Connection classes.

* simplified_version: contains sarsa, sarsa(lambda) and Q-learning for a simplified version of TCP machine state, only with states and actions specific for opening and closing a TCP connection.

* full_version: contains sarsa, sarsa(lambda) and Q-learning for TCP machine state, with no distinction among client and server.


* integrated_version should be able to run all algorithms and have all results in same plot

* client_class files contains RL for the client considered as a RL agent, with a probabilistic server
